# Car-Following-Model-Using-LOESS
This project is done for ISyE6414 Regression Analysis course, which adopts Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) Vehicle Trajectories and Supporting Data from U.S. Department of Transportation and adopts Locally Weighted Regression (LOESS) method to build a car following model, which is able to predict the following vehicle's next-moment velocity based on preceding vehicle's current driving conditions, which could include velocity, acceleration of the preceding vehicle, the time headway (the time to travel from the front-center of a vehicle (at the speed of the vehicle) to the front-center of the preceding vehicle) and the space headway (the distance between the same points of two consecutive vehicles following each other).
